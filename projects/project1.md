# NIT Project Assignment
## 1 - Travel Blog

### Objective
The goal for this project is to build a Travel Blog with HTML, CSS, and JS.
You will be storing the data in `localstorage` and optionally consuming content from an external `REST API`

### Features
#### A list of travel locations
- Build a list of locations you travelled to
- The following information should be shown:
  - The Name of the city and country
  - When you were there, maybe a from and to date
  - A description about the trip
  - Be creative, you can add as much information as you want!
  - This list should be read from and written to the local storage

#### A form to add travel locations
- A user should be able to add travel locations with the needed information
- You can experiment with the various input elements, e.g. `<input type=“date” />` or `<textarea>`

### Bonus tasks
#### 1- A user should be able to remove travel locations

#### 2- Show the current weather of the travel location
* We can fetch the current weather of the travel location using the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api)
* Show it as one of the information in your travel location
* Dependent on the weather, you could show different icons

#### 3- Show a map with its location on a map
- So far, we have not played around with embedding a Google Map. If you want to, feel free to play around with the [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/overview) and how to integrate it in your app. You could then show the travel location on a map for every travel location.
- Show a map owith all travel locations

#### 4- A user should be able to edit travel locations

### Considerations
- First do a low fidelity sketch (pen and paper work great) of what your website is going to be like
- When starting to implement focus on creating the HTML and CSS first, JS becomes much simpler when you already have an UI to code for
- Your CSS should be a in a seperate CSS file and linked to the HTML pages with the `link` tag
- Style your website at will, feel free to use a CSS framework like Bootstrap, Bulma or Tailwind
- You can ask the teacher for support at any time
- Need a new challenge? Let Helder know!
