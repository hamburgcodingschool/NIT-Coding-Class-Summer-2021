# NIT Project Assignment
## 2 - Pok√©dex

### Objective
The goal for this project is to build an index of Pokemon with HTML, CSS, and JS.
You will be consuming content from an external `REST API` and optionally storing data in `localstorage`

### Features
#### A list of Pokemon
- Show a list with the first 151 Pokemon
- The following information should be shown:
  - Id,
  - Name

#### Detail information
- A user should be able to select a Pokemon and see more detailed information
  - Image (for the image the API provides both image sprites and official artwork, choose what fits your design the best)
  - Height
  - Weight
  - Base experience
  - List of abilities

### Bonus tasks
#### 1- Various sprites in detail information
User should be able to select wether to see the front or back sprite, default or shiny version to achieve this you can use `<input type="radio">` or `<select>`

#### 2- Favorites
- The user should be able to add or remove Pokemon from a favorites list, this should be stored in `localstorage`

#### 3- Sort
- Allow the user to sort the list by name or id

#### 4- List with images
- Add an image to the list of Pokemon to accompany the Id and Name

### Considerations
- First do a low fidelity sketch (pen and paper work great) of what your website is going to be like
- When starting to implement focus on creating the HTML and CSS first, JS becomes much simpler when you already have an UI to code for
- Your CSS should be a in a seperate CSS file and linked to the HTML pages with the `link` tag
- Style your website at will, feel free to use a CSS framework like Bootstrap, Bulma or Tailwind
- You can ask the teacher for support at any time
- Need a new challenge? Let Helder know!
